# Java Text Adventure lib for SDFP August Kata

The basic implementation of [Michael's haskell stuff](https://github.com/MHova/text-adventure-framework). What he accomplished in like 10 lines of haskell is here in about 90 lines of Java. 

Everything you need to get started is in Game.java. Define some GameData fields, add some case statements in the logic method, and make some initial data in the main method.
